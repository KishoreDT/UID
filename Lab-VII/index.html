        <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Our vision is to be an exemplary institution that thrives on its commitment to the transformative 
            power of value based education, providing the impetus to develop the expansiveness to harmonize both 
            scientific knowledge and spiritual understanding, so as to utilize knowledge for societal benefit and

        <h2>Global Impact</h2>
        <p id="p3">At Amrita, we stand united in our mission towards solving globally recognized scientific and societal 
            challenges, including environment, development, and health. Amrita stands at the strategic juncture of 
            two streams of cultures: East and West. It is our vision to bring the two together to bridge the divide 
            through meaningful collaborations with world-class universities and innovative approaches that will benefit 
            the entire planet.</p>

        <h2>Education for Life</h2>
        <p id="p1">There are two types of education: education for living and education for life. 
            Studying to become a professional is education for a living, while, education for 
            life requires an understanding of the essential human values. At Amrita, we believe 
            that education should also impart a culture of the heart, based on enduring values and 
            inner strength. Amrita’s culture of education helps to inculcate in our students the right 
            ethos to be rooted in the values of Dharma (righteousness), Karuna (compassion) and Shraddha 
            (mindfulness). Endowed with qualities of acceptance, patience, self-confidence, perseverance 
            and enthusiasm, the benefit of humanity will become uppermost in the students’ thoughts, words 
            and actions. They will then pioneer innovative solutions for the benefit of all humankind, 
            leading to sustainable health and prosperity for all. This resonates with the ancient Sanskrit 
            prayer ‘Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu’. It is a reminder of our deeper connection to the 
            entire world around us, “May our work contribute to the happiness of all beings.” </p>

        <h2>Compassion Driven Research</h2>
        <p id="p2">Our motivation to pursue research is focused on alleviating major global problems related to 
            poverty, starvation, sickness, environmental pollution and contamination. We believe that if 
            we could transform compassion from a mere word into a path of action, we would be able to address 
            most of the world’s problems. If we take this step courageously, then our research and its outcomes 
            will have a special impact, spontaneity, and power. This has translated into many latest advancements 
            and innovations that have culminated in greater societal benefit. </p>
